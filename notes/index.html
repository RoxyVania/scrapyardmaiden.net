        <p class="bgpurple center VCR" style="width:75%">text dump of idk change notes or some shit? i'm dumb as hell so i figure it might be mildly funny to see me lose my mind in the form of what is basically a fancy txt file<br>
            <br>
            12/15/2024 (i think?) look i'm gonna gonna be 100% honest with you, i have no fucking clue what i'm doing.<br>
            but uhhh, idk i got words on the screen and shit i guess? and some pictures?<br>
            anyway, socials are gonna be listed below because i may as well put something here.<br>
            i'll try and figure out how to wrap this in css or something next time i'm tired ig.<br>
            <br>
            1/7/2025 #1) idk what i'm doing still but the words are pink and red so that's cool i guess</br>
            <br>
            1/7/2025 #2)tried adding a custom font but it doesn't fuckin work within firefox so idek why i bothered :( <br>
            also i'm ngl this took way longer than i'd like to admit but like idk what i'm doing so uhhh get fucked lmao<br>
            <br>
            1/8/2025 the background looks good now at least, and uhh idk the textbox has a purple bg... (i'm fucking lost lmfao idk what i'm doing)<br>
            idk dude this shit hurts my fuckin brain, changed the header and uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk made the bg blurry and shit.<br>
            i'll eventually remove this dumbass block of text, but idk what else to put here atm besides silly ass cat pictures<br>
            <br>
            1/9/2025 #1) i tried learning scss and now my brain wants to fugkig explode so im gonna go play warframe instead of trying to fix this bullshit<br>
            like deadass how the fuck is this shit so complicated i just wanna make the button purple<br>
            <br>
            1/9/2025 #2) ok i decided to simplify things and just stick to html and css. i don't need to overcomplicate this and burn myself out early.<br>
            <br>
            1/9/2025 #3) lotta progress (at least as far as i'm concerned.) in terms of moving things over to pure html/css. i've got the buttons back and working, i've moved this text dump to it's own page, and i've realized that it's probably better to do inline css for simple one off shit like font sizes. i'm probably just gonna be lazy and push this for now (if you're seeing this, #1) why? and #2) i got lazy lol), but i'll probably continue to work on this tomorrow.
